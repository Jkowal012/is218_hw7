### Setting Environment Variables for QR Code Customization

```sh
docker run -d --name qr-generator \
  -e QR_DATA_URL='https://example.com' \
  -e QR_CODE_DIR='qr_codes' \
  -e QR_CODE_FILENAME='exampleQR.png' \
  -e FILL_COLOR='blue' \
  -e BACK_COLOR='yellow' \
  my-qr-app
```
Customizes the QR code generation settings through environment variables.



### Combining Volume Sharing and Environment Variables

```sh
docker run -d --name qr-generator \
  -e QR_CODE_DIR='qr_codes' \
  -e FILL_COLOR='blue' \
  -e BACK_COLOR='yellow' \
  -v /host/path/for/qr_codes:/app/qr_codes \
  my-qr-app
```

A comprehensive command that configures the QR code settings and mounts volumes for QR codes.

## Setting the arg for the url from the terminal
```sh
docker run -v .:/app qrcode --url htt/www.nobdoy.com
```
This is how you would set the url for the qr code
